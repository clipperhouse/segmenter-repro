In 1664, the city was named in honor of the [[Duke of York]], who would become King [[James II of England]]. James's older brother, King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], had appointed the Duke [[Proprietary colony|proprietor]] of the former territory of [[New Netherland]], including the city of [[New Amsterdam]], which England had recently seized from the Dutch.<ref name="Archdeacon2013a">{{cite book|authorlink1=Thomas J.

===Early history===

In the [[Pre-Columbian era|precolonial era]], the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] Native Americans, including the [[Lenape]]. Their homeland, known as [[Lenapehoking]], included Staten Island, Manhattan, the Bronx, the western portion of Long Island (including the areas that would later become the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens), and the [[Lower Hudson Valley]].<ref>Evan T.

The [[New York City Fire Department|Fire Department of New York]] (FDNY), provides [[fire protection]], technical rescue, primary response to biological, chemical, and radioactive hazards, and [[emergency medical services]] for the five boroughs of New York City. The FDNY is the largest municipal [[fire department]] in the United States and the second largest in the world after the [[Tokyo Fire Department]]. The FDNY employs approximately 11,080 uniformed [[firefighter]]s and over 3,300 uniformed [[emergency medical technician|EMTs]] and [[paramedic]]s. The FDNY's motto is ''New York's Bravest''.

The fire department faces multifaceted firefighting challenges in many ways unique to New York. In addition to responding to [[list of building types|building types]] that range from wood-frame single family homes to [[High-rise|high-rise structures]], there are many secluded bridges and tunnels, as well as large parks and wooded areas that can give rise to brush fires.

New York City is well known for its street [[parade]]s, which celebrate a broad array of themes, including holidays, nationalities, human rights, and major league sports team championship victories. The majority of parades are held in Manhattan. The primary orientation of the annual street parades is typically from north to south, marching along major avenues.

===Accent and dialect===
{{Main|New York City English|New York accent}}
The New York area is home to a distinctive regional speech pattern called the [[New York City English|New York dialect]], alternatively known as ''Brooklynese'' or ''New Yorkese''. It has generally been considered one of the most recognizable accents within [[American English]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Newman |first=Michael |year=2005 |chapter=New York Talk |title=American Voices |editor1-first=Walt |editor1-last=Wolfram |editor2-first=Ben |editor2-last=Ward |pages=82–87 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4051-2109-5}}</ref>

The traditional New York area accent is characterized as [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]], so that the sound {{IPA|[ɹ]}} does not appear at the end of a [[syllable]] or immediately before a [[consonant]]; therefore the pronunciation of the city name as "New Yawk."<ref name=NYT19930214/> There is no {{IPA|[ɹ]}} in words like ''park'' {{IPA|[pɑək]}} or {{IPA|[pɒək]}} (with vowel backed and [[vowel breaking|diphthongized]] due to the low-back chain shift), ''butter'' {{IPA|[bʌɾə]}}, or ''here'' {{IPA|[hiə]}}. In another feature called the low back chain shift, the {{IPA|[ɔ]}} vowel sound of words like ''talk'', ''law'', ''cross'', ''chocolate'', and ''coffee'' and the often [[homophonous]] {{IPA|[ɔr]}} in ''core'' and ''more'' are tensed and usually raised more than in [[General American]] English. In the most old-fashioned and extreme versions of the New York dialect, the vowel sounds of words like "girl" and of words like "oil" became a diphthong {{IPA|[ɜɪ]}}. This is often misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the ''er'' and ''oy'' sounds, so that ''girl'' is pronounced "goil" and ''oil'' is pronounced "erl"; this leads to the caricature of New Yorkers saying things like "Joizey" (Jersey), "Toidy-Toid Street" (33rd St.) and "terlet" (toilet).<ref name=NYT19930214/> The character [[Archie Bunker]] from the 1970s [[sitcom|television sitcom]] ''[[All in the Family]]'' was an example of having used this pattern of speech.

The classic version of the New York City dialect is generally centered on [[middle class|middle]] and working-class New Yorkers. The influx of non-European immigrants in recent decades has led to changes in this distinctive dialect,<ref name=NYT19930214/> and the traditional form of this speech pattern is no longer as prevalent among general New Yorkers as it has been in the past.<ref name="NYT19930214">{{cite news |last=Sontag |first=Deborah |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE0D61438F937A25751C0A965958260 |title=Oy Gevalt!

New York City's comprehensive transportation system is both complex and extensive.

===Rapid transit===

Mass transit in New York City, most of which runs 24 hours a day, accounts for one in every three users of mass transit in the United States, and two-thirds of the nation's rail riders live in the New York City Metropolitan Area.<ref name="MTAinfo">{{cite web |title=The MTA Network: Public Transportation for the New York Region |publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority |url=http://web.mta.info/mta/network.htm |accessdate=August 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Pisarski |first=Alan |title=Commuting in America III: Commuting Facts |publisher=Transportation Research Board |date=October 16, 2006 |url=http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/CIAIIIfacts.pdf |accessdate=August 30, 2012}}</ref>

New York City is also known for its rules regarding turning at red lights.
